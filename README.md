## What is React-Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc.

It's used to develop applications on many operating systems with React framework along with native platform capabilities.

## What is Expo

[Expo](https://expo.dev) is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

It's used to easily translate React framework to the native language of your device.

## How will we compile ?

We simply have to launch a packager between expo and your phone.

To do this, simply run `expo start`.

Press `d` to open developer tools and enable `tunnel mode`.

Then, scan the qr code on your phone to have your new application. (On your camera for iOS and in Expo App for Android)
