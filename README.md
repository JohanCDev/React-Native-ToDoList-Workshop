## What is React-Native

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc.

It's used to develop applications on many operating systems with React framework along with native platform capabilities.

[Expo](https://expo.dev) is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

It's used to easily translate React framework to the native language of your device.
